cordova-node-plugin
===================

DEPRECATED

Use [nodejs-mobile-cordova](https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile-cordova) instead.

This Cordova plugin provides node to your Android device.
Only works on Android devices that use ARM processors.

Many thanks to @mafintosh for the node libraries!

This is designed to work with [Bunsen Browser](https://github.com/bunsenbrowser/bunsen). There is an example of a node express server here: https://github.com/bunsenbrowser/bunsen/tree/master/bunsen-ang/src/assets .
